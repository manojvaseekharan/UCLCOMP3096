UCL COMP3096 - Group Research Project
===================

## Readability ##
This repo hosts the Visual Studio plugin used in the research project centred around using metrics such as the user's gaze, mouse activity, lines in view and more to infer the readability of a piece of code. 

We aim to directly compare our findings against statically computed metrics, in particular Cyclomatic Complexity.
